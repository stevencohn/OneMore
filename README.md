### Why?

I wanted something more than what OneNote provided. I was overwhelmed by _OneNote Gem_,
aghast at its bloated useless overloads of what was already otherwise available or features that
I would never use in a million years - and, oh yeah, that price! I admit I was intrigued by the
_Onetastic Macro_ approach but thought it limited and obtuse, decipherable only by programmers.
And both of these charge money for something that should be open source and neither provided exactly
what I wanted. So I did what any self respecting software engineer would do... I built my own.

**Please Support**  
I do this as a hobby. I will never charge you to use OneMore. So it is with great humility and
appreciation that I humbly request that you consider a small donation to support the development
of OneMore. In exchange, I pledge to continue listening with an open mind and to respond to your
questions and tips in a timely manner.
