## 💾 How to Install OneMore

1. Close OneNote if it is currently running (See below if you need to install OneNote)
2. Download the [latest installer from here](https://github.com/stevencohn/OneMore/releases/latest)
   - Use the x86 installer only if you are running on a 32-bit Windows machine; it has nothing to do
     with the bitness of Office itself.
   - Use the x64 installer when running on a 64-bit Windows machine for either 32-bit or 64-bit Office.
4. Right-click the downloaded installer msi and choose Properties, then tick the Unblock box and click OK
5. Run the installer
   - If you're currently logged in as a user with admin rights and this is the account with which you will 
     use OneMore then you will be able to start OneNote immediately.
   - Other users on the system will experience a slight delay the first time they log in after OneMore
     is installed while settings are applied to their accounts. This only occurs once.
   - If you're currently logged in as a user without admin rights, you can install OneMore if you have
     the user name and password of an account with admin rights. See below for further instructions.
5. Run OneNote and enjoy

#### Install from a normal user account
The OneMore installer requires admin rights to complete configuration and update the Windows Registry.
If you have the user name and password of an account with admin rights, you can run the OneMore installer
from your current account using this command entered from a console window:

    runas /user:<username> "msiexec.exe /i <path-to-installer>"

where &lt;username&gt; is the user name of an account with admin rights and
&lt;path-to-installer&gt; is the full path to the OneMore installer .msi file

You wil be prompted for the password of the admin user. The installation will continue.

```diff
- You must sign out and then sign in again before you will see OneMore in the OneNote ribbon.
```

### How to Upgrade OneMore

The OneMore installer is built such that it can be installed on top of an older version and will
effectively perform an _upgrade_. This is the preferred method and can be done in one of two ways:

1. Open the OneMore About dialog and click Check for updates. If there is a new version available,
you will be given the option of upgrading. OneNote will be shut down to perform the upgrade.
2. Or, download the OneMore installer and run it. There is no need to uninstall the previous version;
the new installer will simply overwrite the old files and _upgrade_ OneMore. Note that when you
download the installer, you will need to unblock it by opening its Properties dialog and clicking
the _Unblock_ checkbox.

### How to Install OneNote

OneNote can be installed after installing Office or even installed standalone without Office at all.

1. Optionally install Office - do not run the Setup.exe; instead, run Office\Setup64.exe
   - Download OfficeSetup.exe [from here](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/install-or-reinstall-onenote-for-windows-c08068d8-b517-4464-9ff2-132cb9c45c08)
   - If run standalone, it will install 32-bit OneNote
   - If run after installing Office, it will install 32 or 64 bit based on the bitness of Office
1. Download the standalone OneNote installer (does not require Office or can be installed ontop of Office)
   - The standalone OneNote 64-bit installer is [here](http://www.onenote.com/download/win32/x64/en-US)
   - The standalone OneNote 32-bit installer is [here](http://www.onenote.com/download/win32/x86/en-US)

Note that Microsoft has changed its OneNote strategy. Instead of promoting the OneNote for Windows 10 app,
which sucks in my opinion, they are now working on combining the best features from that app into a new
desktop edition, hopefully to be released in 2022.

## Languages
OneMore is translated to *Arabic, Chinese (Simplified), Dutch, English, French, German, Polish, Portuguese, and Spanish*. Please let me know if you'd like it translated to another language. I use my [ResxTranslator](https://github.com/stevencohn/ResxTranslator) program to automate the translations but can also override inaccuracies of specific words and phrases. If you think a translation is not correct, again please let me know.

### OneMore in the Media

* [How to Increase the Functionality of OneNote With OneMore Add-In](https://www.makeuseof.com/increase-functionally-onenote-with-onemore-add-in/)

### Why?

I wanted something more than what OneNote provided. I was overwhelmed by _OneNote Gem_,
aghast at its bloated useless overloads of what was already otherwise available or features that
I would never use in a million years - and, oh yeah, that price! I admit I was intrigued by the
_Onetastic Macro_ approach but thought it limited and obtuse, decipherable only by programmers.
And both of these charge money for something that should be open source and neither provided exactly
what I wanted. So I did what any self respecting software engineer would do... I built my own.

**Please Support**  
I do this as a hobby. I will never charge you to use OneMore. So it is with great humility and
appreciation that I humbly request that you consider a small donation to support the development
of OneMore. In exchange, I pledge to continue listening with an open mind and to respond to your
questions and tips in a timely manner.

## Developing OneMore

Are you programmer? Whether you're a professional or just curious, please feel free to explore
the source code and have a play. See the [Developer Notes](../../wiki/~-Developer-Notes) page
in the Wiki where I keep a list of technical references and information regarding developing
and debugging this OneNote add-in.

### Minimum Prerequisites for Development

* Developed for Windows 10
* Microsoft Visual Studio 2019<sup>1</sup> including Office primary interop assemblies
* Microsoft [Windows 10 SDK](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/downloads/windows-10-sdk/)<sup>2</sup>
* Microsoft [Visual Studio 2019 Installer Projects extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=VisualStudioClient.MicrosoftVisualStudio2017InstallerProjects)
* .NET Framework 4.8
* Microsoft OneNote 2016 32-bit or 64-bit

<sup>1</sup>_VSCode cannot be used since it doesn't support COMReference entries in csproj files_ 

<sup>2</sup>_The Windows 10 SDK is required to reference the Windows.winmd meta file located
at "C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\UnionMetadata\10.0.**version**.0\Windows.winmd"
where **version** is the version of the SDK you have installed, e.g. 19041. If your SDK has
a different version then you must replace the **Windows** reference in OneMoreAddin.csproj_

Tested recently with:
* Windows 11 Pro 21H2 22000.918
* Windows 11 SDK 10.0.22000.832
* Visual Studio 2022 17.3.2

   * Normalizes HTML and non-conformant XML to well-formed XML that can be consumed by XElement.Parse
* [InputSimulator](https://github.com/michaelnoonan/inputsimulator) - nuget, MIT license
