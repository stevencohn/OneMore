### Why?

I wanted something more than what OneNote provided. I was overwhelmed by _OneNote Gem_,
aghast at its bloated useless overloads of what was already otherwise available or features that
I would never use in a million years - and, oh yeah, that price! I admit I was intrigued by the
_Onetastic Macro_ approach but thought it limited and obtuse, decipherable only by programmers.
And both of these charge money for something that should be open source and neither provided exactly
what I wanted. So I did what any self respecting software engineer would do... I built my own.

**Please Support**  
I do this as a hobby. I will never charge you to use OneMore. So it is with great humility and
appreciation that I humbly request that you consider a small donation to support the development
of OneMore. In exchange, I pledge to continue listening with an open mind and to respond to your
questions and tips in a timely manner.

### Minimum Prerequisites for Development

* Developed for Windows 10
* Microsoft Visual Studio 2019, C# 7
* Microsoft [Visual Studio 2019 Installer Projects extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=VisualStudioClient.MicrosoftVisualStudio2017InstallerProjects)
* .NET Framework 4.8
* Microsoft OneNote 2016 32-bit or 64-bit

_Note that VSCode cannot be used since it doesn't support COMReference entries in csproj files_ 

Tested recently with Windows 10 2004 (19041.450), VS2019, and OneNote 2019/O365

#### Dependencies

* [HtmlAgilityPack](https://www.nuget.org/packages/HtmlAgilityPack) - nuget, MIT license
* [MarkdownDeep](https://github.com/toptensoftware/markdowndeep) - DLL in external folder
* [PuppeteerSharp](https://www.nuget.org/packages/PuppeteerSharp/) - nuget, MIT license


### How to Install OneMore

1. Close OneNote if it is currently running (See below if you need to install OneNote)
2. Download the [latest installer from here](https://github.com/stevencohn/OneMore/releases/latest)
3. Right-click the downloaded installer msi and choose Properties, then tick the Unblock box and click OK
4. Run the installer
   - If OneNote is installed for _all users_ then you must install OneMore for _all users_ as well
5. Run OneNote and enjoy


### How to Install OneNote

Microsoft has been pushing people to use the OneNote app and OneNote online, which suck in my opinion, and have removed OneNote from the Office 2019 installer. But you can still install it after installing Office or even install it standalone!

1. Optionally install Office - do not run the Setup.exe; instead, run Office\Setup64.exe
1. Download OfficeSetup.exe [from here](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/install-or-reinstall-onenote-for-windows-c08068d8-b517-4464-9ff2-132cb9c45c08)
   1. If run standalone, it will install 32-bit OneNote
   1. If run after installing Office, it will install 32 or 64 bit based on the bitness of Office
